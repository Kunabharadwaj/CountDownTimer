This countdown timer app utilizes JavaScript DOM manipulation to update the countdown display dynamically. Here are some key concepts used:

document.getElementById('timer'): Retrieves the DOM element with the ID 'timer', which is used to display the countdown.

setInterval(updateCountdown, 1000): Calls the updateCountdown function every 1 second to update the countdown.

timerElement.innerHTML: Sets the inner HTML of the 'timer' element to display the countdown.

clearInterval(intervalId): Stops the interval for updating the countdown when the countdown ends.

new Date().getTime(): Gets the current timestamp in milliseconds.

The countdown timer app is styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing appearance. The following styles are applied:

Background: A gradient background color is applied to the body using the background property with the linear-gradient function.
